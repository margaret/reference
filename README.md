## Markdown

### Markdown TOC

http://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/

Quickly generate a table of contents for a Markdown file via the webpage. It's kind of buggy around handling puncutation and links in titles, but works well enough + you don't have to install anything.

### Markdown Live Preview

http://markdownlivepreview.com/

Good if you just need to check something quickly in the browser. Doesn't do full GitHub markdown.

### Stackedit

https://stackedit.io/

Editor + live preview in browser. You can just use it, or you cna make an account and save stuff. I haven't used it in a while but I think it isn't limited to just markdown. 

## LaTeX

### ShareLatex

https://www.sharelatex.com/

Editor + live rendering in browser. I used this a lot for my homework assignments back in the day. 

# Python

## Learning

### Hitchhiker's Guide to Python

http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/

I think this one is pretty canonical but I reference it a lot and I think it does a good job covering practical / ecosystem sort of material.

### UC Berkeley Self-paced Python

www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~selfpace/cs9honline/

I was a TA for this course years ago but I still reference the site sometimes when trying to explain things to new learners or brush up on stuff. Most of the projects aren't terribly practical but I like a lot of the conceptual explanations, like for scope, mutation, objects. Coincidentally it looks like a lot of this material was originally written over a decade ago by the guy who wrote `star-destroyer`. A lot of classic intro programming material as well.

## Tools

### star-destroyer

https://github.com/zestyping/star-destroyer

Tool to help remove `import *` from project code.

# GNSS (GPS)

## Learning 

### NovAtel Intro to GNSS

http://www.novatel.com/an-introduction-to-gnss/

This one looks really old (like back when the civilian GPS had error added to it) but most of the core stuff seems right. I like the level of detail it goes into as a first-pass. Not a textbook but more in-depth than most one-pager articles.
